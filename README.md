# 🎯 The step by step work is as follows: 
* Design Coordination- Collected client requirements and coordinated with internal 3D Designers and ensured design alignment with client's expectations and vendor feasibility.
* Bill of Material(BOM) Preparation- Created a detailed BOM after finalizing the design in which I defined material specifications, quantities, and components for cost estimation.
* Vendor Costing & Quotation- Shared BOM with international vendor(Europe) for costing and prepared and issued a client quotation combining pricing and 3D Design visuals.
* Contract Management- Drafted and executed the client contract upon commercial approval and prepared vendor contract to confirm production scope and pricing.
* Material & Furniture Documentation- Designed material description documents to ensure accurate production and also created a furniture list for client confirmation.

Throughout the project, I managed communication between internal teams, international vendors, and the client. I also ensured documentation accuracy and alignment across all stakeholders.
